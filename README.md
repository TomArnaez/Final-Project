# Adversarial Robustness and Improved Generalisation Through Weight Variability

This project investigated how introducing variability (i.e. noise) into the weights of a neural network during training can reduce over-fitting and improve generalisation, and furthermore evaluated the ability of the proposed method to defend against adversarial attacks, or test its effective against other input corruptions.
